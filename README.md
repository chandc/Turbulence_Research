This repository contains high order Spectral Element Codes developed in FORTRAN with high spatial accuracy and second order in time marching scheme.

We achieved statistical stationary state in a channel flow simulation to demonstrate the unique capability of the Least Sqaures Spectral Element method.Results are documented in the accompanied papers.
